Hereâ€™s a simpler explanation for exporting all files from a directory in JavaScript:

---

### Imagine This Directory:
You have a folder called `utils` with these files:
```
/utils
  - helper1.js
  - helper2.js
  - constants.js
```

---

### Step 1: Add an `index.js` File
In the same folder, create a file named `index.js`.

---

### Step 2: Export Everything in `index.js`
Inside `index.js`, write code to "re-export" the content of the other files.

#### Example:
```javascript
export { default as helper1 } from './helper1'; // Exports everything from helper1.js
export { default as helper2 } from './helper2'; // Exports everything from helper2.js
export * from './constants';                   // Exports named constants from constants.js
```

---

### Step 3: Import All from the Folder
Now you can import everything from the `utils` folder like this:
```javascript
import { helper1, helper2 } from './utils';
import { SOME_CONSTANT } from './utils';
```

---

### Why Do This?
Using an `index.js` file makes it easy to organize and group exports from many files in a folder. Instead of importing from each file separately, you can just import from the folder.

Let me know if this clears things up!
